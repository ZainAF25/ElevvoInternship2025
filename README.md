# Elevvo Internship Projects

This repository contains four data analysis and visualization projects completed during my internship. Each project focuses on data cleaning, analytics, or visualization using different tools and techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Project 1: Titanic Data Analysis and Visualization
**Tools & Languages:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Summary:**  
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover survival trends based on gender, class, family size, and passenger titles. The project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual insights through correlation heatmaps and survival rate plots.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure Python is installed.  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Place the `trainn.csv` dataset in the same directory as the script.  
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python titanic_analysis.py
   ```

## ðŸ’¾ Project 2: Sales Insights using SQLite (Chinook Database)
**Tools & Languages:** Python, SQLite3  

**Summary:**  
Analyzed music store sales data using SQL queries on the Chinook database. Extracted insights such as top-selling tracks, revenue per region, and monthly sales performance through dynamic query execution in Python.

**How to Run:**
1. Place the `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite` database in the same directory as the script.  
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python sales_insights.py
   ```
3. The script prints analysis results directly in the console.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project 3: Walmart Sales Forecasting (Time Series)
**Tools & Languages:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels  

**Summary:**  
Analyzed Walmart sales data to detect trends and seasonal patterns. Applied moving averages and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) for forecasting future sales and generated visual reports for insights.

**How to Run:**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib statsmodels
   ```
2. Place `Walmart_with_Region.csv` in the same folder.  
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python walmart_forecast.py
   ```
4. Generated plots (`total_sales_trend_ma.png`, `seasonal_decomposition.png`, `sales_ses_forecast.png`) will appear in the project folder.

## ðŸ“Š Project 4: Retail Insights Dashboard (Power BI)
**Tools:** Power BI Desktop  

**Summary:**  
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for retail sales insights using a cleaned Superstore dataset.  
The dashboard visualizes total revenue, regional performance, product-level sales, and order trends.

**How to View:**
1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Explore visuals like revenue by category, region, and product.  
3. Use slicers to filter data by year or customer segment.
